# Movie Recommender System using Content-Based Filtering

This project aims to develop a movie recommender system utilizing content-based filtering techniques. The system is built using Python and employs TMDB 5000 movies dataset for analysis and recommendation purposes.

## Features

- **Content-Based Filtering**: The recommender system is based on content-based filtering, which recommends movies similar to those a user has liked in the past.
  
- **Interactive Web Interface**: An interactive web interface has been developed using Streamlit, allowing users to easily interact with the recommender system and receive movie recommendations.

## Technologies Used

- **Python**: The project is primarily developed using Python programming language.
  
- **TMDB 5000 Movies Dataset**: The dataset from The Movie Database (TMDB) containing information about 5000 movies is used for analysis and recommendation.
  
- **Streamlit**: Streamlit is utilized for building the interactive web interface, providing a seamless user experience.
  
- **PyCharm**: PyCharm IDE is used for ML data analysis and development purposes.

## Usage

To use the movie recommender system:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Install the required dependencies by running `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
3. Run the Streamlit web app using `streamlit run app.py`.
4. Access the web interface in your browser and interact with the recommender system to receive movie recommendations based on your preferences.

## Implementation Details

The recommender system employs cosine similarity to find similarities between movies based on their features. It analyzes various attributes of movies such as genres, cast, crew, and keywords to recommend similar movies to users.
